      <h1 class="h1"> Challenges</h1>
      <p class="p"> In this lab, We are to create a layout using float properties.
      We firt get to design how it will look by sketching it and deciding what
    will be added on out website</p>
      <h2> Difficulties</h2>
      <p> There were many difficulites on how to even start this lab because
      I honestly did not know where to start. I did not know why we needed all
    these files until my partner told me what they were for and why we needed
  them. This goes for both the float and flexbox files. Both of these files were
confusing to work with and I was havinga difficult time trying to get them to work.
Overall, my partner helped me for the most of the time which was great because now I
knew what I was doing.</p>
      <h3> Results</h3>
      <p> I would say that they turned out okay in terms of the layout. It is
      pretty generic but with my skills, that is the best that I could do. </p>
