  			<h1 class="h1">Challenges</h1>
  			<p class="p1">In Lab 15, we were challenged to experiement with new fancy CSS we learned from the lecture. we are to try to use new features such as text shadow, box shadow, gradient, and so on.</p>

  			<h2 class="h2">Difficulties</h2>
  			<p class="p2">I had difficulties regarding the gradient. I wanted to have a gradient background that dealt with a radius but when I wuld go and add the coding, it would repeat multiple times. it was looking bad and I triied to import the code "no repeat" but that did not work as well. I added the white background which is where I add my text and images and that seemed to work because the more I writng the more of the bakground extends. I also had difficulties fixing the results and putting it on the left because it kind of overlaps the game over image. I tried adding padding to the image but then it messed up the difficulties paragraph. Other than the gradient background, I had no other difficulties with the other features such as transform, filters, rounded corners, and more.</p>

  			<h3 class="h3">Results</h3>
  			<p class="p3">I enjoyed this lab because I was able to experiement with the new features that I learned in lecture. I really liked playing around with the rounded corners, shadows, and filters because it adds a lot of depth and character to the images rather than having them plain with no added enhancments towards them. Overall, I enjoyed this lab and it was very interesting to play around with them.</p>
