<p>Hello! My name is Anthony Lopez Zamora (I sometimes go by Tony) and I am a second year comunication design major with a concentration in visual design and I am from Watsonville, California. I would love to be a graphic designer at a game company such as Blizzard, Epic, and Nintendo. I really enjoy drawing/painting, photagraphy, listening to music and podcasts, and playing video games. I draw mostly people, landscapes, and animals because they are the most fun to draw/paint.My favorite genres that I listen to are RnB, regae, and kpop and the games that I mostly have been playing are Overwatch, Fortnite, and a little bit of hades. Thank you for reading!</p>
