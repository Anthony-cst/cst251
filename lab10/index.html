  	<h1 class="h1" style="color: #F2F4FF;"> Styling Text Elements </h1>
  	<p class="p1" style="color: #F2F4FF;">In this lab, I am to create proper files and an index file for this lab and to style my text.
  	</p>

  	<h2 class="h1" style="color: #F2F4FF;"> Challenges</h2>
  	<p class="p1" style="color: #F2F4FF;">	The challenges I was facing is going with a different aproach by trying to have my headers side by side, adding bullets to create a list, and adding in headers to my website.
  	</p>

  	<h3 class="h1" style="color: #F2F4FF;">Problems</h3>
  	<p class="p1" style="color: #F2F4FF;"> The problems I was facing were trying to add my text in the border that I created and adding fonts that will not blend in with my background. especially because my background is black. 
  	</p>

  	<h4 class="h1" style="color: #F2F4FF;">Results</h4>
  	<p class="p1" style="color: #F2F4FF;"> The results came out well and great. I really like adding gifs to my websites so I added two giifs. I also realized the reason why my main border wasnt surrounding the texts was because of the amount of divs that were messing up my html. Overall I enjoyed this lab and had a great time with it.
