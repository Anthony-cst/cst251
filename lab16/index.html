  		<p> I have had some difficulties regarding the new feautres that I learned in lecture such as animations, transistions, and columns. I was having a difficult time with animations because there were so many animation to choose from I did not know where to start. Although I have learned about the coding for animations, some of it I had struggles with and was still new to me. When it came to transitions, The image that I used for transtions was overlapping my other bodies of text and it started out as a very big image. I had done some adjustments and in the end it turned out great. Lastly, I was having a hard time on the columns. I have worked with columns in previous labs but it had been so long that I had to check back and see what I have done. The same thing happened where it overlapped the results section and it did not turn out to be actual columns. But again with adjustments and thinking deeply, I was able to fix my errors. </p>

  		<h3>Results</h3>
  		<p> Overall, I was very satisfied with the results with the layout, transitions, animations. and everything. I will say one thing I would want to improve on is learning more about transitions and collumns because I felt like I was limited to work with the transtions that I used. It took me a while to get the transitions to work but I would say it turned out pretty good. I like the layout of my web page but I do want to experiement with other layouts. In conclusion, I am happy with the results of this webpage.</p>
