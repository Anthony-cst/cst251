<h1> Lab 4:File transfer</h1>
	<p> In this assignment, we are to test our local files and use github to upload them to the server.
<h2> Difficulties</h2>
<p> I would say that there were no difficulties because I mostly done all the tasks beforehand. I will say that adding the images once again was a bit of a struggle but I used my other labs as refrence to help guide me.
<h3> Results </h3>
<p> All the files work great and do not have any flaws. I double checked to see if each web page works and they indeed do.
