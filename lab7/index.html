    <h1> Intro to CSS</h1>
      <p>In this lab, we are to create a lab seven index
        and style it with css</p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>Some difficulties I was having is inputing the coding in the css file, creating
      folders and files, and trying to get the css to work. I was mostly having issues
      with the last one because there were moments where I was having a rough
      time trying to get the css to work. But after some help from my partner, I
      was able to have everything working and showing up on the broswer</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>The results is that it turned out pretty well. although i was having difficulty with adding a background
      for the text, overall I would say that it worked out great.</p>
