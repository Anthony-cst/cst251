    <p class="p1"> In lab 13, we were challenged to use block-level styling and css to recreate a webpage that was provided to us in the articles. We are to try and make it look just like the original.
  	</p>

    <h2 class="h2" style="color: #383580;"> Difficulties </h2>
    <p class="p2"> I had a lot of difficulties regarding what I should add in order to replicate this webpage that I chose to do.
      For one, I could load in the exact font.
      I tried adding the coding in the css file but that didnt work so I tried to add it in the
      html file but that also did not work. I also tried my best adding the
      purple and salmon colored half ovals or circles but I could only try my
      absolute best and this is the outcome of those features. I did load in
      the font in font squirrel but I did not know what to do next after I load
      the font in.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="color: #383580;"> Results </h3>
		<p class="p3"> The results of this lab was not what I wanted and it came out
      looking a bit different than the original. I will say that I did target the
      colors and the centering of the text, but, aside from that, everythiing else
      did not look the way that I wanted it to look like.
