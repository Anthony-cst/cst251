    <p class="p1"> In this lan, we are to challange ourselves even more and
      recreate a complicated website and post it on our html using the iframe coding.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" style="color: #383580;"> Difficulties </h2>
    <p class="p2"> I did have difficulties recreating this website as well but not as much
      as I did with lab 13 because I kind of had a different aproach to this lab
      since I was just all over the place with the previous lab. The difficulties
      include, creating columns, nav bars, changing the font of one word in a paragraph, and more.
      All of these things I had little experince because they were all new to me
      and the website that I chose had these features. I did get assistence from my
      parnter and online resources which helped a lot. For the font change, I
      had to add a span extension and I had to separate the steel header with
      the three lines on the right so that I was ableto customize them more
      freely. </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="color: #383580;"> Results </h3>
  	<p class="p3"> I would say that I tried my best to replicate it and make it
      as identical as possible for the chosen website. It was equally as dificult
      but what helped me was the different approach that I conducted. Overall, I would
      say I did a mediocre job and I definetly understood how to tackle these assignments. </p>
