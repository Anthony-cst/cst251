    <div class="column" style="background color:transparent;">
        <p style="color: #17114F;">I write for creative professionals and curios minds. Are you moved
          by the mysterious power of words? Do you love to uncover the meanings
          and nuances of verbal and visual language? Dou you seek to be fully
          awake and live deliberately with open eyes and heart - or as Thoreau said,
          to "suck all the marrow out of life"? If so, then this newsletter is for
          you. </p>
        <p style="color: #17114F;"> Here's <span class="font">what you'll get in each email:</span> Articles and meditations on a
          range of topics from creativity, deisng, and books, to mindfulness,
          spirituality, and questions that arise in the dark night of the soul.
          Occasional poems by myself and guests. And maybe a little recommended
          reading of relightful fragments of arcana.</p>
        <p style="color: #17114F;"> <span class="font">Love letters</span> will launch shortly after my full website, so sign up today
          and stay tuned! In the meantime, check out one of my best articles
          over on Medium.
