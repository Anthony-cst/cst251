		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>In this lab, We had to create sketches for my teams project website. We need to draw sketches of how our website's layout.</p>

		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>I did not really have a lot of difficulties with this lab but I did have two. One being on what the layouts are going to look like for each of the ideas we had. I tried my best to stray off of websites to keep them original but I was struggling so I did use some for reference. The other issue I was having is that I was spending way to much time on one sketch when I should have spent at least 2 mins. Later on I was noticing it so I did not spend much more time on them. </p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>I would say that I am pretty satisfied with the sketches that I made. I tried to make them different and adding shapes for images and having the titles placed differently. I would like to draw a logo. Overall, I enjoyed designes the website layouts.</p>
