         <h1>More Complicated HTML</h1>
         <img src="img/carousel.jpg" alt="picture for lab6" width="600px">
         <p>In this lab, we are to create an html file and then style it with a CSS file.</p>
         <h2>Difficulties</h2>
         <p>I would say that I did have a lot of difficulties regarding the form
				 and the css files. I did not know how to start the form but with the
			 help of my partner, I was able to continue forward with the lab. The CSS
		 files was not working with lab three which I found odd. I tried my best to
	 find the solution and turns out that I did not have two very important links
	 where the head was. </p>
         <h3>Results</h3>
         <p> The results of the site came out pretty great. The change between a
				 simple white background to a nice gray background which I found
			 pleasing to view. Overall, it was a struggle but my site looks pretty good.</p>
