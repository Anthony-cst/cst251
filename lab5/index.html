 <h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
 	<p>The purpose of this lab is to create a webpage that includes images and links to some of my favorite websites.</p>
 <h2>Dificulties</h2>
    <p> I would say that there were no difficulties during this lab. I did have ine difficulty which was again trying to have the images show up on the broswer but after asking my partner, I was able to make the images show up and work. Overall, the whole process was fairly easy and it was a great learning experience. </p>
 <h3>Results</h3>
    <p> I am fully satisfied with the results of this lab because all the images work, the links to my favorite images work, and the image that links to another site works as well. The image that has the link is the sunflower image which if you go to it, it directs you to a website about flowers. These pictures were taken by me which I decided to just add in here. In conclusion, I am proud of the results.</p>
